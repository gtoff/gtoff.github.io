## Cloud Robotics Initiative @ ICCLab 2024

I currently lead the **Cloud Robotics Initiative** at Distributed Systems Group @ InIT (a.k.a. ICCLab). 
Our mission is to advance the synergy between cloud computing, robotics, and AI through research, education, and community engagement.

---

## **Overview**

At ICCLab, we focus on:
- **Research**: Pioneering robotics and cloud integration through Innosuisse and EU Horizon Europe projects.
- **Education**: Teaching robotics, guiding BSc/MSc theses, and hosting impactful workshops.
- **Dissemination**: Sharing knowledge at meetups, conferences, and topic groups.

## **Research Highlights**

#### **NEPHELE Project (2022–2025)**
A lightweight software stack for managing IoT, edge, and cloud computing with use cases like:
- **Search and Rescue (SAR)**: Coordinating emergency responses with a system-of-systems approach.

#### **ECRP with Rapyuta Robotics**
- Supporting advancements like [Rapyuta Robotics Series C](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/2022/04/20/series-c-eng/).
